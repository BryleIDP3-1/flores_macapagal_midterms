    <h1>Welcome to a debate between Early Bird and Night Owl</h1>

    <h2>Early Bird vs Night Owl</h2>

    <p>Greetings! Here we will be discussing the two most common routines that people have in the world regarding their lifestyle. They either love waking up in the morning to a beautiful sunshine and the relaxing sounds of nature or they either prefer the vibes and quietness of the night sky.</p>
        
    <p>They are known to be called as the early birds and the night owls, two types of sleeping phases, patterns, or even personalities. They are famously called this, as every morning when all of nature’s animals such as birds and squirrels wake up early to start the day, most nocturnal animals such as owls, racoons, and bats are wide awake, in sight of the moonlight. </p>   
   
    <p>In short terms, other people like to wake up super early in the morning to start their day and get on with their work, while others usually wake up very late and are most productive at night until midnight. This is because either their brain functions are more active at certain times or they have different body clocks and sleeping patterns. Below is where we will discuss what these are, their uniqueness, and which is better regarding productivity, health, and other factors. </p>

            <li><b>Alignment with the Schedule:</b> The standard time for corporate and school start is early in the morning, therefore you are in-line with the most common time frame of the world.</li>
            <li><b>Overall Health:</b> Waking up early, eating a good breakfast, having the time to workout outdoors and be exposed to sunlight can increase your health levels and vitamin D.</li>
            <li><b>Increase Happiness:</b> Studies show that waking up in the morning is a great way to boost your happiness, improve mental health and moods, and become more satisfied.</li>

        <h3>Disadvantages of being an early bird…</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Different Sleeping Patterns: Maybe you might be a night owl and are less productive during the day or you are used to working at night via a shift or a time zone change.</li>
            <li>Causing Sleep Deprivation: Sleeping and waking up early can lead to fewer hours of sleep, especially if you miss the usual time you sleep. For example, going to bed late and waking up extremely early which can result in less than 8 hours of sleep.</li>
            <li>Raising Stress Levels: For other people, waking up early can lead to stress and anxiety as sometimes sleep cycles are disrupted and deregulated.</li>
            <li>Unhealthy habits: Waking up early from a lack of sleep can increase your desire for too much coffee in the morning, which can boost your energy, but can have bad effects.</li>
            <li>Mood and Concentration: If you are always tired from insufficient hours of sleep, your mood can change, becoming temperamental and also obtain poor concentration.</li>
            <li>Less Time in Evening: As mentioned, usually early birds work in the morning leading to less time for themselves, activities, and family because they are tired in the evening.</li>
        </ul>
