    <h1>Welcome to a debate between Early Bird and Night Owl</h1>

    <h2>Early Bird vs Night Owl</h2>

    <p>Greetings! Here we will be discussing the two most common routines that people have in the world regarding their lifestyle. They either love waking up in the morning to a beautiful sunshine and the relaxing sounds of nature or they either prefer the vibes and quietness of the night sky.</p>
        
    <p>They are known to be called as the early birds and the night owls, two types of sleeping phases, patterns, or even personalities. They are famously called this, as every morning when all of nature’s animals such as birds and squirrels wake up early to start the day, most nocturnal animals such as owls, racoons, and bats are wide awake, in sight of the moonlight. </p>   
   
    <p>In short terms, other people like to wake up super early in the morning to start their day and get on with their work, while others usually wake up very late and are most productive at night until midnight. This is because either their brain functions are more active at certain times or they have different body clocks and sleeping patterns. Below is where we will discuss what these are, their uniqueness, and which is better regarding productivity, health, and other factors. </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Different Sleeping Patterns: Maybe you might be a night owl and are less productive during the day or you are used to working at night via a shift or a time zone change.</li>

            <li>Mood and Concentration: If you are always tired from insufficient hours of sleep, your mood can change, becoming temperamental and also obtain poor concentration.</li>
            <li>Less Time in Evening: As mentioned, usually early birds work in the morning leading to less time for themselves, activities, and family because they are tired in the evening.</li>
